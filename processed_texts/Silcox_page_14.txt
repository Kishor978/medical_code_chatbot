DEEPER DIVE INTO: BEHAVIOR IDENTIFICATION 
ASSESSMENTS
Per the Steering Committee Supplemental Guidance sent to Providers or found in the Members Only 
section of www.apbahome.net
• Q: Is 97151 intended to be used for day-to-day assessment and treatment planning? 
• A: No. This code is intended for reporting initial assessment and treatment plan development and 
reassessment and progress reporting by the QHP (timeframes for reassessments are determined by payer 
policy or medical necessity). 97151 includes face-to-face time with the patient and/or caregivers to 
conduct assessments as well as non-face-to-face time for reviewing records, scoring and interpreting 
assessments, and writing the treatment plan or progress report. The QHP must have conducted both the 
face-to-face and non-face-to-face activities to report this service. Day-to-day assessment and treatment 
planning by the QHP are bundled into the treatment codes 97153-97158 and 0373T; therefore, 97151 
cannot be used to report those indirect services because they do not meet all requirements of the code 
descriptor.
