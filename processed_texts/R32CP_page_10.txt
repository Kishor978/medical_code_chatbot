A reason code may be retired if it is no longer applicable or a similar code exists. 
Retirements are effective for a specified future and succeeding versions, but contractors also 
can discontinue use of retired codes in prior versions. The regular code update notification 
will establish the deadline for Medicare contractors to retire a reason code that could be 
earlier than the version specified in the WPC posting. The committee approved the following 
reason code changes in June 2003.
