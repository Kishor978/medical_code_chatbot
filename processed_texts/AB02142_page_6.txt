Implementation of Reason and Remark Codes 
 
As instructed before, shared system maintainers must provide a crosswalk between the reason and 
remark codes to the shared system internal codes so that a carrier or DMERC or intermediary can 
easily locate and update each internal code that may be impacted by a remittance advice 
reason/remark code change to eliminate the need for lengthy and error prone manual 
carrier/DMERC/intermediary searches to identify each affected internal code.  
 
The effective date of programming for use of new or modified reason/remark codes applicable to 
Medicare is the earlier of the date specified in  the contractor manual transmittal or PM requiring 
implementation of a policy change that led to the issuance of the new/modified code, or the date 
specified in the periodic  PM announcing issuance of the code  changes. Contractors must notify 
providers of the new and/or modified codes and their meanings in a prov ider bulletin or other 
instructional release prior to issuance of remittance advice transactions that include these changes. 
 
Medicare contractors must use appropriate remark codes in conjunction with the appropriate reason 
code(s) when applicable, and must make sure th at they are using the currently valid reason and 
remark codes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effective date for this Program Memorandum (PM) is January 1, 2003. 
 
The implementation date for this PM is January 1, 2003. 
 
These instructions should be implemented within your current operating budget. 
 
This PM may be discarded after January 1, 2004.
