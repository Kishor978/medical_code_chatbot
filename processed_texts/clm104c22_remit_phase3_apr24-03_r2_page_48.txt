NOTE:  Previously, CMS only required corrections to the "pay to" address.  However, 
with the implementation of this new initiative, CMS requires corrections to all addresses 
before the contractor can remove the DNF flag and begin paying the provider or supplier 
again.  Therefore, do not release any payments to DNF providers until the provider 
enrollment area or the NSC has verified and updated all addresses for that provider's 
location. 
Contractors must initially publish the requirement that providers must notify the 
intermediary and carrier or NSC of any changes of address, both on their Web sites and 
in their next regularly scheduled bulletins.  Contractors must continue to remind suppliers 
and providers of this requirement in their bulletins at least yearly thereafter. 
See Chapter 1, ยง80.5, for additional information pertaining to the DNF initiative. 
50.2 - SPR Formats 
A3-3754 
(Rev.) 
The following sections contain the separate carrier/DMERC and intermediary SPR 
formats.  These are the general formats.  The actual SPRs may contain additional (or 
fewer) lines, i.e., the contractor may need to add a line for additional reason code(s) after 
first reason code line.
