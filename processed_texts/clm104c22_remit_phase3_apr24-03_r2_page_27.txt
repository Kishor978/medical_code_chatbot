AMT02  Required.  Inpatient or partial hospitalization per diem amount (DY) 
mapped to ff record 44, field 22.  NL mapped to ff record 44, field 24.  
Hemophilia add on (ZK) mapped to ff record 44, field 26.  F5 mapped to 
ff record 44, field 28.  I mapped to ff record 44, field 30.  Any inpatient 
outlier payment (ZZ) mapped to ff record 44, field 32.  AU mapped to ff 
record 44, field 34.  The other qualifiers do not apply to Medicare at this 
time. 
AMT03  Not used. 
QTY (064)  Situational, but required for Medicare if any of the QTY01 qualifiers  
 apply.  Use multiple loops if more than 1 qualifier applies. 
QTY01  Required.  CA mapped to ff record 44, field 35; NA mapped to ff record 
 44, field 37; LA to ff record 44, field 39; CD to ff record 44, field 41; ZK 
 mapped to ff record 44, field 43; and OU mapped to ff record 44, field 45. 
QTY02  Required.  CA mapped to ff record 44, field 36.  NA mapped to ff record 
 44, field 38.  LA mapped to ff record 44, field 40.  CD mapped to ff record 
 44, field 42.  ZK is mapped to ff record 44, field 44.  OU is mapped to ff 
 record 44, field 46.  The other qualifiers in the implementation guide do 
 not apply to Medicare at this time. 
NOTE 1: VS, visits, had been reported at the service level for covered and 
noncovered HHA visits prior to version 4010.  With HH PPS, it will only 
be necessary to report HHA visits if there are 4 or fewer visits during an 
episode.  In version 4010, the number of visits, when 4 or less, will be 
reported as the line adjustment quantity (SVC level CAS04, 07, 10, 13, 16, 
or 19) for the final HHA bill for the episode.  The HHA will still be paid 
on a per visit basis in that situation. 
NOTE 2: Pre-4010, FL was used to report the approved units for 
hemophilia add on.  FL is not available for use in the 4010 implementation 
guide.  Use ZK to report the hemophilia covered units in version 4010.  
SVC Situational, but required for Medicare when service level detail 
included on the incoming claim.  A separate loop is required for each 
procedure. 
SVC 
SVC01-1  Required.  Only HC, NU, N4 and ZZ apply to Medicare intermediaries.  
HC mapped to ff record 50, field 13; NU mapped to ff record 50, field 13; 
ZZ mapped to ff record 50, field 13; N4 mapped to ff record 50, field 15.  
HC and ZZ would not apply to the same line, but NU and HC or NU and 
ZZ could apply to the same line.  When more than one applies to the same 
line, enter the HC or ZZ in SVC01-1 and the NU in SVC04.  ZZ will be 
used to report HIPPS codes if used in SNF or HHA billing.  (Contrary to
