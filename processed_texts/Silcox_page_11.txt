EXAMPLE OF BALANCE #3:  
SUPERVISED FIELDWORK VS DIRECTION OF TECHNICIAN
.
(PARAPHRASED FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE)
DIRECTION
“Direction” refers to the QHP directly monitoring the delivery of 
treatment to a patient by a behavior technician. The focus is on ensuring 
that treatment protocols are implemented correctly in order to 
maximize benefit to that patient. 
Direction of a technician includes, but is not limited to, the QHP 
frequently observing the technician implementing the patient’s protocols 
with the patient, providing instructions and confirming or corrective 
feedback as needed, and/or demonstrating correct implementation of a 
new or modified treatment protocol with the patient while the 
technician observes, followed by the technician implementing the 
protocol with the patient while the QHP observes and provides 
feedback.  
Time reported and billed must be face-to-face time with the patient. 
SUPERVISION
“Supervision” of a technician or other employee by a QHP generally refers 
to processes through which the QHP ensures that the supervisee 
(a) practices in a competent, professional, and ethical manner in accordance 
with the standards of the profession; (b) engages with and follows the 
employer’s policies and procedures; (c) continues to develop their 
knowledge and skills; and (d) receives the personal support needed to cope 
with the stressors and demands of their position. 
“Supervision” may also involve activities to enable compliance for obtaining 
or maintaining a professional credential, or to fulfill ethical responsibilities. 
Supervision activities that do not involve delivery of services directly to 
patients are generally not reportable or billable to health plans using CPT 
codes, though some payers may allow them to be billed using HCPCS or 
other codes.
