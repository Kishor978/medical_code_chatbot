ADVOCACY IS ESSENTIAL
• Use all available resources to discuss the intent of the codes with Payers
• Payer provider reps and claims specialists are learning the codes too.
• If the Payer Policy is not documented and published, don’t take the guidance in a phone call that is 
misaligned with the intent without seeking to speak to a decision maker with the health plan and ask for 
information in writing.
• The Supplemental Guidance was designed to SHARE with health plans during discussion.
• Advocate for your Business!
• Participate in your state ABA Chapter
• Become a leader in advocating for the industry.
• There are ways to collaborate that don’t violate anti-trust laws. Be well versed in what is considered a 
violation and steer clear of those activities; but work together collectively in your mission to educate and 
train the health plans to better understand the intent and implementation needs.
