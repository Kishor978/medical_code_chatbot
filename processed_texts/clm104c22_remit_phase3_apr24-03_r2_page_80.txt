2-120-QTY does not apply to a first bill/payment in an episode.  This data element is 
used for home health payment only when payment is based on the number of visits (when 
four or fewer visits) rather than on the HIPPS. 
70.5 - 835 Version 3051.4A.01 Line Level Reporting Requirements for 
the Claim Payment in an Episode (More Than Four Visits)  
A3-3753 
(Rev.) 
1. Intermediaries reverse the initial payment for the episode.  They repeat the data 
from the first bill in steps 1-7 in §70.4, but change the group code to ‘CR’ and 
reverse the amount signs, i.e., change positive amounts to negatives and negatives 
to positives. 
2. Intermediaries enter 'CW' (claim withholding) and repeat the reversal amount 
from 2-070-SVC03 in 3-010-PLB for this remittance advice.  This will enable the 
first 60-day payment to be offset against other payments due for this remittance 
advice. 
3. The full payment for the episode can now be reported for the end of episode bill. 
a. Intermediaries repeat steps 1-11 from §70.4 for the service as a reprocessed 
bill.  They report this data in a separate claim loop in the same remittance 
advice.  Up to six HIPPS may be reported on the second bill for an episode. 
b. In addition to the HIPPS code service loop, Intermediaries also enter the 
actual individual HCPCS for the services furnished.  They include a separate 
loop for each service.  Revenue code '27x', '623', '27x', and '62x' services may 
not be billed with a HCPCS, and must be reported in a separate SVC loop in 
the remittance advice. 
c. Intermediaries report payment for the service line with the HIPPS in the 
HCPCS data element at the 100 percent rate (or the zero rate if denying the 
service) in step 9. 
d. Intermediaries report group code 'CO', reason code '97' (Payment included in 
the allowance for another service/procedure), and zero payment for each of 
the individual HCPCS in the 2-070-SVC segments.  Payment for these 
individual services is included in that HIPPS payment.  Intermediaries do not 
report any allowed amount in 2-110.A-AMT for these lines.  They do not 
report a payment percentage in the loops for HCPCS included in HIPPS 
payment(s). 
e. Intermediaries enter the appropriate appeal or other line level remark codes in 
2-130-LQ.  There are no messages specific to home health HIPPS payments.
