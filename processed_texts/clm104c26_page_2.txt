10 - Health Insurance Claim Form CMS-1500 
(Rev. 3083, Issued:  10-02-14, Effective:  CMS-1500:  01-06-14, ICD-10 - Upon 
Implementation of ICD-10, Implementation:  CMS-1500:  01-06-14, ICD-10 - Upon 
Implementation of ICD-10) 
 
The Administrative Simplification Compliance Act (ASCA) requires that Medicare 
claims be sent electronically unless certain exceptions are met.  Providers meeting an 
ASCA exception may send their claims to Medicare on a paper claim form.  (For more 
information regarding ASCA exceptions, refer to Chapter 24.) 
 
Providers sending professional and supplier claims to Medicare on paper must use Form 
CMS-1500 in a valid version.  This form is maintained by the National Uniform Claim 
Committee (NUCC), an industry organization in which CMS participates.  Any new 
version of the form must be approved by the White House Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) before it can be used for submitting Medicare claims.  When the NUCC 
changes the form, CMS coordinates its review, any changes, and approval with the OMB. 
 
The NUCC has recently changed the Form CMS-1500, and the revised form received 
OMB approval on June 10, 2013.  The revised form is version 02/12, OMB control 
number 0938-1197. 
 
The revised form will replace the previous version of the form 08/05, OMB control 
number 0938-0999.  
 
Throughout this chapter, the terms, “Form CMS-1500,” “Form 1500,” and “CMS-1500 
claim form” may be used to describe this form depending upon the context and version.  
The term, “CMS-1500 claim form” refers to the form generically, independent of a given 
version. 
 
Medicare will conduct a dual-use period during which providers can send Medicare 
claims on either the old or the revised forms.  When the dual-use period is over, Medicare 
will accept paper claims on only the revised Form 1500, version 02/12. 
 
For the implementation and dual-use dates, contractors shall consult the appropriate 
implementation change requests for the revised Form 1500.  Providers and other 
interested parties may obtain the implementation dates on the CMS web site @ 
www.cms.gov. 
 
Reminder:  Regardless of the paper claim form version in effect:  Providers cannot 
submit ICD-10-CM codes for claims with dates of service prior to implementation of 
ICD-10. 
 
Medicare A/B MACS (B), DME MACS, physicians, and suppliers are responsible for 
purchasing their own CMS-1500 claim forms.  Forms can be obtained from printers or 
printed in-house as long as they follow the specifications developed by the NUCC.  
Photocopies of the CMS-1500 claim form are NOT acceptable.  Medicare will accept any
