CONCURRENT BILLING…CONTINUED
• The descriptor for code 97155 adds that the service may include *simultaneous* direction of a technician by the 
QHP ,  and the CPT Assistant article reads: "Adaptive behavior treatment by protocol (97153) is administered by 
a technician under the direction of a physician/other QHP ,  who may provide direction during the actual 
treatment, which represents face-to-face treatment delivered to a patient. 
• The QHP designs the treatment protocols, assists the technician in adhering to the protocols, and analyzes the 
technician-recorded data to determine whether the protocol is producing adequate progress (97155)" and 
"Code 97155 may be reported in two scenarios: when the QHP is delivering the treatment with the client 
(according to the code descriptor) one-to-one or when the QHP is directing the technician in delivering 
treatment (code 97153) and both the technician and the client are present." 
• Both the CPT code book and the CPT Assistant article list codes that cannot be billed concurrently with each of 
the codes in the 2019 code set. For 97155 that list does not include 97153.
