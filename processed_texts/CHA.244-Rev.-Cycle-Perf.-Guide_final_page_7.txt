Prioritization of Billing and 
Payer Follow Up
After the revenue cycle score cards have been completed and reviewed by the revenue cycle performance improvement 
team, prioritization of billing and payer follow up should begin as soon as possible. Prioritizing billing and payer follow up 
will result in improvement across multiple metrics. New processes will need to be clearly communicated to patient financial 
services and health information management staff. It is also recommended that a lead is identified in each department 
to help support leadership in ensuring progress is made and to help with identifying and resolving workflow issues.

Billing Prioritization: Payer Follow Up: 
All denials should have a unique write-off code so 
reports can be easily pulled to identify what types of 
denials are being received and the percentage of denials 
compared against the total number of claims. Denials 
should be tracked and discussed with the revenue cycle 
performance improvement team when meeting to 
determine root causes and what can be done to prevent 
denials in the future. The cost of denials makes up an 
estimated 20 percent of revenue expenses.
