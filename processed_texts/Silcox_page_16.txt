97152 – BEHAVIOR IDENTIFICATION SUPPORTING 
ASSESSMENTS
• Q: Does the descriptor for 97152 indicate that technicians can perform assessments 
independently? 
• A: No. This code is for reporting supplemental assessments conducted by the technician that the 
QHP determines are needed to develop the treatment plan or progress report (see code 
97151).  Additionally, as indicated in the clinical example, the QHP reviews the assessment 
procedures with the technician and has the technician practice recording data.  That may occur 
on the day of an assessment session with a patient or several days leading up to the session(s).  
That work by the QHP is bundled into the value of code 97152 and is not reported separately.
