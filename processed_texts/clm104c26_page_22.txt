• The National POS Code Set and Instructions for Using It 
 
The following is the current national POS code set, with facility and 
nonfacility designations noted for Medicare payment for services on 
the Physician Fee Schedule. As a new POS code is established, the 
health care industry is permitted to use this code from the date that it 
is posted on the Medicare Place of Service Code Set Web page at 
http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/place-of-service- 
codes/Place_of_Service_Code_Set.html which is typically expected to 
be some months ahead of the final effective date for Medicare use. 
 
The code set is annotated with the effective dates for this and all 
other codes added on and after January 1, 2003. Codes without 
effective dates annotated are long-standing and in effect on and 
before January 1, 2003.
