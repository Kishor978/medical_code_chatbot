EXAMPLE OF BALANCE #5:  RATES
INTENT
• With new Codes, new Fee Schedules 
should follow.
• With new Fee Schedules, discussion of 
appropriate rates should be an option.
• With new Codes and Fee Schedules, 
discussion of Code intent and full 
program needs should be allowed.
IMPLEMENTATION
• Most plans have self cross-walked 
current Fee Schedules from old codes to 
new codes based on their interpretation.
• Continued Education needs to occur 
using the materials and resources that 
describe intent of the codes and the 
needs required for an ABA program.
• Providers should bill their Usual and 
Customary Rate and not contracted 
rate.
