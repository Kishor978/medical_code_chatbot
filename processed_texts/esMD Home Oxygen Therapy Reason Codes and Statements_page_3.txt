OX406 
The blood gas study obtained during exercise does not include testing during exercise 
without oxygen. Refer National Coverage Determination 240.2 & Local Coverage 
Determination L33797. 
OX407 
The blood gas study obtained during exercise does not include testing during exercise 
with oxygen applied to demonstrate the improvement of the hypoxemia.  Refer 
National Coverage Determination 240.2 & Local Coverage Determination L33797. 
OX408 
The medical record documentation does not indicate all three oximetry studies for 
exercise testing were performed within the same testing session. Refer to Local 
Coverage Determination L33797. 
OX409 
The medical record documentation does not support a valid blood gas study obtained 
during sleep. Refer to National Coverage Determination 240.2 & Local Coverage 
Determination L33797. 
OX410 
The medical record documentation does not include an overnight oximetry testing of a 
minimum of two hours for criterion 3, Group I coverage. Refer to National Coverage 
Determination 240.2 & Local Coverage Determination L33797. 
OX411 
The medical record documentation does not include an overnight oximetry showing a 
decrease of PO2 more than 10 mm Hg or oxygen saturation more than 5 percent from 
baseline saturation for Group 1. Refer to National Coverage Determination 240.2 & 
Local Coverage Determination L33797. 
OX412 
The medical record documentation includes an overnight oximetry showing a decrease 
of more than 5 percent from baseline saturation taken during sleep, however does not 
support symptoms or signs reasonably attributable to hypoxemia. Refer to National 
Coverage Determination 240.2 & Local Coverage Determination L33797. 
 
Reason 
Code POLYSOMNOGRAPHY / OSA 
OX500 
The medical record documentation does not support the obstructive sleep apnea was 
appropriately and sufficiently treated such that the underlying condition resulting in 
hypoxemia is unmasked before oxygen saturation results obtained during sleep testing 
are considered qualifying for oxygen therapy. Refer to Local Coverage Determination 
L33797. 
OX501 
The medical record documentation does not support a qualifying oxygen saturation test 
during a titration polysomnographic study, for a beneficiary with obstructive sleep 
apnea. Refer to Local Coverage Determination L33797. 
OX502 
The medical record documentation does not support the titration polysomnography 
study was conducted over a minimum of two hours. Refer to Local Coverage 
Determination L33797.
