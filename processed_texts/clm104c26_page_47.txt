Number of services: 10 
MTUS (miles): 10 
MTUS indicator: 1 
 
C. Anesthesia Time Units - (CWFB_MTUS_IND_CD = 2) 
 
For claims reporting anesthesia time units in 15-minute periods or fractions of 15-
minute periods, the following example should be used to code the line item: 
 
A total of 1 allowed service is reported for HCPCS code 00142:  Anesthesia for 
procedures on eye; lens surgery.  The anesthesiologist attended the patient for 35 
minutes. 
 
Number of services: 1 
MTUS (time units): 23 (one decimal point implied) * 
MTUS indicator: 2 
*Two 15-minute periods + 1/3 of a 15-minute period equals 2.3 
 
D. Services/Pricing Units - (CWFB_MTUS_IND_CD = 3) 
 
For claims reporting a service or pricing unit, the following examples should be 
used to code the line item: 
 
Example 1:  A total of 2 visits was reported for HCPCS code 99211:  Office or other 
outpatient visit for the management of an established patient. 
 
Number of services: 2 
MTUS (services): 2 
MTUS indicator: 3 
 
Example 2:  A total of 500 milligrams was administered for HCPCS code J0120:  
Injection, Tetracycline, up to 250 mg. 
 
NOTE:  The number of milligrams should not be reported in the service or MTUS fields.  
Instead, report the number of pricing units.  In this case, up to 250 mg equals 1 
unit/service.  Thus, 500 mg equals 2 units/services. 
 
Number of services: 2 
MTUS (services): 2 
MTUS indicator: 3 
 
Example 3:  A total of 24 cans was purchased, each containing 300 calories for HCPCS 
code B4150:  Enteral Formulae, 100 calories. 
 
NOTE:  Neither number of cans nor the number of calories should be reported in 
the services or MTUS fields.  Instead, report the number of pricing units.  In this
