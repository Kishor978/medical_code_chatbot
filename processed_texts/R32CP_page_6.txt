MA03 If you do not agree with the approved amounts and $100 or more 
is in dispute (less deductible and coinsurance), you may ask for a 
hearing.  You must request a hearing within 6 months of the date 
of this notice.  To meet the $100, you may combine amounts on 
other claims that have been denied. This includes reopened 
reviews if you received a revised decision.  You must appeal each 
claim on time. At the hearing, you may present any new evidence 
which could affect our decision. 
 
An institutional provider, e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility 
(SNF), home health agency (HHA) or a hospice may appeal only 
if the claim involves a reasonable and necessary denial, a SNF 
noncertified bed denial, or a home health denial because the 
patient was not homebound or was not in need of intermittent 
skilled nursing services, or a hospice care denial because the 
patient was not terminally ill, and either the patient or the 
provider is liable under Section1879 of the Social Security Act, 
and the patient chooses not to appeal.
