CAS (020)  Situational.  May only be used if there are claim level adjustments.  
Adjustments reported at the service level may not be reported again, 
individually or in total, at the claim level.  Unlike prior 835 versions, 
version 4010 does not require entry of an OA 93 message in a claim level 
CAS when there are no claim level adjustments.  Payers, including 
Medicare, are prohibited from use of any reason code that is not valid 
for use with version 4010 in the official reason code compendium 
maintained at http://www.wpc-edi.com/.  This list is updated 3 times a 
year in the months following the X12 meetings â€“ in March, July and 
November.  See the service level CAS segment for more information on 
Medicare use of the CAS.
