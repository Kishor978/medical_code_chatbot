If the insured reports a terminating event with regard to insurance which had been 
primary to Medicare (e.g., insured retired), enter the word "NONE" and proceed to item 
11b. 
 
If a lab has collected previously and retained Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) 
information for a beneficiary, the lab may use that information for billing purposes of the 
non-face-to-face lab service.  If the lab has no MSP information for the beneficiary, the 
lab will enter the word “None” in Block 11, when submitting a claim for payment of a 
reference lab service.  Where there has been no face-to-face encounter with the 
beneficiary, the claim will then follow the normal claims process.  When a lab has a face-
to-face encounter with a beneficiary, the lab is expected to collect the MSP information 
and bill accordingly.
