does not apply to Medicare intermediaries, as indicated in the 
implementation guide note for the standard, this situational segment “is 
used to provide additional information used in the process of adjudicating 
this service.” Since intermediary claims are not subject to splitting, 
provider control number is not used for Medicare adjudication and is not 
needed by providers to re-associate lines for split claims. None of the 
other qualifiers currently apply to intermediaries.
