EXAMPLE OF BALANCE #2:  TREATMENT BY
PROTOCOL
INTENT
• Per the Steering Committee Guidance 
and CPT Manual, Treatment by Protocol 
can be substituted by a QHP .
• With this substitution, health plans 
should be willing to provide a means for 
a QHP reimbursement rate to be 
equivalent to that provider level of 
service.
IMPLEMENTATION
• Some health plans do have a means to 
identify the level of provider rendering 
treatment by protocol and reimburse at 
a matching rate (eg TRICARE billing by 
provider or funders with modifiers and 
matching rates on fee schedules).
• Some health plans have documented that 
this service will be reimbursed at the 
technician rate without modifier.
