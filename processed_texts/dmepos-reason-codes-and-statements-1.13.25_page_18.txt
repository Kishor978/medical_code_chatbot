Reason 
Code SPINAL ELECTRICAL OSTEOGENESIS STIMULATOR (E0748) 
OS100 
The medical record documentation does not support a failed spinal fusion where a 
minimum of nine months has elapsed since the last surgery. Refer to National 
Coverage Determination 150.2, Local Coverage Determination L33796, and Policy 
Article A52513. 
OS101 
The medical record documentation does not support a multilevel spinal fusion surgery 
which involves 3 or more vertebrae. Refer to National Coverage Determination 150.2, 
Local Coverage Determination L33796, and Policy Article A52513. 
OS102 
The medical record documentation does not support a history of a previously failed 
spinal fusion at the same spinal fusion site. Refer to National Coverage Determination 
150.2, Local Coverage Determination L33796, and Policy Article A52513. 
 
Reason 
Code ULTRASONIC ELECTRICAL OSTEOGENESIS STIMULATOR (E0760) 
OS200 
The medical record documentation does not include a minimum of two sets of 
radiographs prior to starting treatment with the osteogenesis stimulator, separated by a 
minimum of 90 days.  Each set must include multiple views of the fracture site and a 
written interpretation by a practitioner stating there has been no clinically significant 
evidence of fracture healing between the two sets of radiographs. Refer to National 
Coverage Determination 150.2, Local Coverage Determination L33796, and Policy 
Article A52513. 
OS201 
The medical record documentation supports the fracture is of the skull or vertebrae. 
Refer to National Coverage Determination 150.2, Local Coverage Determination 
L33796, and Policy Article A52513. 
OS202 
The medical record documentation supports the fracture is tumor related. Refer to 
National Coverage Determination 150.2, Local Coverage Determination L33796, and 
Policy Article A52513. 
OS203 
The medical record documentation indicates a fresh fracture or delayed union; 
therefore, the use of an ultrasonic electrical osteogenesis stimulator is not medically 
necessary. Refer to National Coverage Determination 150.2, Local Coverage 
Determination L33796, and Policy Article A52513. 
OS204 
The ultrasonic osteogenesis stimulator is non-covered; therefore, the ultrasound 
conductive coupling gel is non-covered. Refer to Local Coverage Determination 
L33796 and Policy Article A52513. 
OS205 The ultrasonic osteogenesis stimulator is not medically necessary as it is being used 
with other noninvasive osteogenesis stimulators. Refer to National Coverage
