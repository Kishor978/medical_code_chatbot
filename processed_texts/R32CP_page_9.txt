X12 N 835 Health Care Claim Adjustment Reason Codes  
The Health Care Code Maintenance Committee maintains the health care claim adjustment 
reason codes. The Committee meets at the beginning of each X12 trimester meeting 
(February, June, and October) and makes decisions about additions, modifications, and 
retirement of existing reason codes. The updated list is posted 3 times a year after each X12 
trimester meeting at http://www.wpc-edi.com/codes/Codes.asp, and select Claim 
Adjustment Reason Codes from the pull down menu. All reason code changes approved in 
June 2003 are listed here. By January 1, 2004, you must have the most current reason code 
set installed for production to make sure that all carriers, intermediaries, and DMERCs are 
using the latest approved reason codes in 835 and standard paper remittance advice 
transactions. 
The request for a reason code change may come from non-Medicare entities. If Medicare 
requests a change, it may be included in a Medicare instruction in addition to the regular 
code update notification. The regular code update notification will be issued on a periodic 
basis to provide a summary of changes in the reason and remark codes introduced since the 
last update notification, and will establish the deadline for Medicare contractors to implement 
the reason and remark code changes that may not already have been implemented as part of a 
previous Medicare policy change instruction.
