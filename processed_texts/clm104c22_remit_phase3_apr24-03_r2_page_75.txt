60.4 - Requests for Additional Codes 
AB-02-142, AB-03-012 
(Rev.) 
The CMS has national responsibility for maintenance of the remittance advice remark 
codes.  Requests for new or changed remark codes should be submitted to CMS via the 
Washington Publishing Company Web page (http://www.wpc-edi.com/HIPAA) remark 
code request function.  Requests for codes must include the name, phone number, 
company name, and e-mail address of the requestor, the suggested wording for the new or 
revised message, and an explanation of how the message will be used and why it is 
needed.  A fax number or mail address is acceptable in the absence of an e-mail address.  
Requests may also be mailed to: 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
OIS/BSOG/DDIS 
Mail Stop N2-13-16 
7500 Security Blvd. 
Baltimore MD 21244-1850 
To provide a summary of changes introduced in the previous four months, a PM will be 
issued if in the last four months (a) any new remark or reason code is introduced; and/or 
(b) an existing code is discontinued; and/or c) the wording for an existing code is 
modified, and at least one of these changes impact Medicare.  These PMs will establish 
the deadline for Medicare standard system and contractor changes to complete the reason 
and/or remark code updates that had not already been implemented as part of a previous 
Medicare policy change instruction. 
70 - Intermediary ERA Requirement Changes to Accommodate OPPS 
and HH PPS 
(Rev.) 
B-02-050, A3-3754 
The type of bill in CLP08 identifies whether a service is an outpatient hospital, 
Community Mental Health Center (CMHC), Home Health Agency (HHA), or other 
category of intermediary processed claim.  A remittance advice does not typically 
identify which of the possible cost bases is being used for payment. 
The CMS had to assure both these PPS payment systems could be accommodated in the 
835 transaction when they were implemented in 2000. 
Changes to accommodate these PPS systems include: 
â€¢ Detailed service line level data will only be reported in 3051.4A.01 and later 
versions of the 835.  Detailed service line data is not reported in paper 
remittance advice notices, or in pre-3051.4A.01 versions of the 835 supported
