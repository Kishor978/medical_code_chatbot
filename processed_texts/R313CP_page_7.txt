X12 N 835 Health Care Claim Adjustment Reason Codes 
The Claim Adjustment Reason Code and Status Code Maintenance Committee maintains the 
health care claim adjustment reason codes.  The Committee meets at the beginning of each X12 
trimester meeting (February, June and October) and makes decisions about additions, 
modifications, and retirement of existing reason codes.  The updated list is posted three times a 
year after each X12 trimester meeting at http://www.wpc-edi.com/codes/Codes.asp.  Select Claim 
Adjustment Reason Codes from the pull down menu.  All reason code changes approved in June 
2004 are listed here.  By January 3, 2005, you must have the most current reason code set installed 
for production to make sure that all Medicare contractors are using the latest approved reason 
codes in 835, standard paper remittance advice, and coordination of benefits transactions. 
The request for a reason code change may come from non-Medicare entities.  If Medicare requests 
a change, it may be included in a Medicare instruction in addition to this regular code update 
notification.  The regular code update notification is issued three times a year to provide a 
summary of changes in the reason and remark codes introduced since the last update notification, 
and will establish the deadline for Medicare contractors to implement the reason and remark code 
changes that may not already have been implemented as part of a previous Medicare policy change 
instruction. 
A reason code may be retired if it is no longer applicable or a similar code exists.  Retirements are 
effective for a specified future and succeeding versions, but contractors can also discontinue use of 
retired codes in prior versions.  The regular code update notification will establish the deadline for 
Medicare contractors to retire a reason code that could be earlier than the version specified in the 
Washington Publishing Company (WPC) posting.  The committee approved the following reason 
code changes in June 2004.
