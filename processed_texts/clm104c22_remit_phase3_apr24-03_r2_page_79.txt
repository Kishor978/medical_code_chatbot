70.4 - 835 Version 3051.4A.01 Line Level Reporting Requirements for 
the Request for Anticipated Payment (RAP) Payment for an Episode 
A3-3753 
(Rev.) 
Intermediaries: 
1. Enter 'HC' (HCPCS revenue code qualifier) in 2-070-SVC01-01, and the Health 
Insurance PPS (HIPPS) code under which payment is being issued in 2-070-
SVC01-02.  The HIPPS code is treated as a type of level 3 HCPCS in version 
3051.4A.1. 
2. Enter '0' (zero) in 2-070-SVC02 for the HIPPS billed amount and the amount they 
are paying in SVC03. 
3. Enter '0023' (home health revenue code) in SVC04. 
4. Enter the number of covered days, as calculated by the standard system for the 
HIPPS, in SVC05, the covered units of service - this number should be 1, 
representing the same date used as the from and through date on the RAP. 
5. Enter the billed HIPPS in 2-070-SVC06-02 with qualifier 'HC' in 2-070-SVC06-
01 if the HIPPS has been down coded or otherwise changed during adjudication. 
6. Enter the start of service date (claim from date) in 2-080-DTM for the 60-day 
episode.  If a revenue code other than '0023' is billed, they report the line item 
date associated with that revenue code instead of the claim from date.  The only 
line item receiving Medicare payment on RAP should be the single '0023' revenue 
code line. 
7. Enter group code 'OA' (other adjustment), reason code '94' (processed in excess of 
charges), and the difference between the billed and paid amounts for the service in 
2-090-CAS.  They report the difference as a negative amount. 
8. Enter '1S' (ambulatory patient group qualifier) in 2-100.A-REF01 and the HIPPS 
code in 2-100.A-REF02. 
9. Enter 'RB' (rate code number qualifier) in 2-100.B-REF01 and the percentage 
code (0, 50, 60) in 2-100.B-REF02. 
10. Enter the appropriate line level remark codes in 2-130-LQ.  There are no 
messages specific to home health HIPPS payments.  There are no appeal rights for 
initial percentage episode payments. 
2-110-AMT (ASC, APC or HIPPS priced amount or per diem amount, conditional) does 
not apply, and should not be reported for either the first or the final remittance advice for 
a HIPPS episode.
