type (i.e., single sheet, snap-out, continuous feed, etc.) of the CMS-1500 claim form for 
processing.  To purchase forms from the U.S. Government Printing Office, call (202) 
512-1800. 
 
The following instructions are required for a Medicare claim.  They apply to both the 
08/05 and 02/12 versions of the form except where noted.  A/B MACs (B) and DME 
MACs should provide information on completing the CMS-1500 claim form to all 
physicians and suppliers in their area at least once a year. 
 
These instructions represent the minimum requirements for using this form to submit a 
Medicare claim.  However, depending on a given Medicare policy, there may be other 
data that should also be included on the CMS-1500 claim form; if so, these additional 
requirements are addressed in the instructions you received for such policies (e.g., other 
chapters of this manual). 
 
Providers may use these instructions to complete this form.  The CMS-1500 claim form 
has space for physicians and suppliers to provide information on other health insurance.  
This information can be used by A/B MACs (B) to determine whether the Medicare 
patient has other coverage that must be billed prior to Medicare payment, or whether 
there is another insurer to which Medicare can forward billing and payment data 
following adjudication if the provider is a physician or supplier that participates in 
Medicare.  (See Pub. 100-05, Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, chapter 3, and chapter 
28 of this manual). 
 
Providers and suppliers must report 8-digit dates in all date of birth fields (items 3, 9b, 
and 11a), and either 6-digit or 8-digit dates in all other date fields (items 11b, 12, 14, 16, 
18, 19, 24a, and 31). 
 
Providers and suppliers have the option of entering either a 6 or 8-digit date in items 11b, 
14, 16, 18, 19, or 24a.  However, if a provider of service or supplier chooses to enter 8-
digit dates for items 11b, 14, 16, 18, 19, or 24a, he or she must enter 8-digit dates for all 
these fields.  For instance, a provider of service or supplier will not be permitted to enter 
8-digit dates for items 11b, 14, 16, 18, 19 and a 6-digit date for item 24a.  The same 
applies to providers of service and suppliers who choose to submit 6-digit dates too.  
Items 12 and 31 are exempt from this requirement.
