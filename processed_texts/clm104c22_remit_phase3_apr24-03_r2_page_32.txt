NOTE: Outpatient PPS instructions had directed intermediaries to identify 
Transitional Outpatient Payments (TOPs) with BN in this data element, 
but some providers associate BN with managed care only and not with fee 
for service payments.  For Medicareâ€™s use of version 4010, report TOPs 
with IS, interim settlement, in PLB03-1 and IR in the first 2 positions of 
PLB03-2.

may intermediaries report anything other than the Medicare provider 
adjustment code in positions 1-2 of this data element.
