COMPLIANCE IN ACTION
â€¢ Seven components that provide a solid basis upon which a practice can create a voluntary 
compliance program: 
1. Conducting internal monitoring and auditing; 
2. Implementing compliance and practice standards; 
3. Designating a compliance officer or contact; 
4. Conducting appropriate training and education; 
5. Responding appropriately to detected offenses and developing corrective action; 
6. Developing open lines of communication; and 
7. Enforcing disciplinary standards through well-publicized guidelines.
