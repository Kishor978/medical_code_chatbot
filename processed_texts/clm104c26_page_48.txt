The CMS implemented a new version of the Form CMS-1490S effective January 1,

form will replace the previous version of the form 01/05, OMB control number 0938-

The term, “Form CMS-1490S” refers to the form generically, independent of a given 
version. 
Medicare will conduct a dual-use period (January 1, 2019 through March 31, 2019) 
during which Beneficiaries (or their representatives) can send Medicare claims on either 
the old or the revised form. When the dual-use period is over, Medicare will accept 
beneficiary paper claims on only the revised Form CMS-1490S, version 01/18.
