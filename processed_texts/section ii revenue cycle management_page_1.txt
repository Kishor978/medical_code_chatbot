Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) 
All administrative and clinical functions that contribute to the capture, management, and collection 
of patient service revenue make up the Revenue Cycle. 
The Revenue Cycle Includes: 
• Front-end processes – collection, scanning/coping, recording and verification of vital 
patient and insurance information; collection of copays and outstanding balances; pre-
authorization and referral requirements. Daily charge capture and payment 
reconciliation.
• Clinical Coding & Documentation – standards must be met; documentation must be 
accurate and complete to support the clinical services provided and coded. “If it is not  
documented it did not happen”. Documentation is proof of services rendered.
• Check-out processes – Charge capture, collections, reconciliation, etcetera.
• Billing Office processes – Reconciliation, charge capture, payment processing, claim 
review and processing, denial management, appeals and account receivable 
management, patient statement and collection activities, report management, payer 
communication and feedback to providers and staff regarding RCM issues. 
Ways to reduce Revenue Cycle issues: 
• Educate providers and staff regarding all processes in the Revenue Cycle and how they 
are interrelated throughout the clinic/practice.
• Invest in a good Practice Management system (PM). Functionality and ease of use is 
essential.
• Choose a robust clearinghouse that permits verification   of   insurance coverage and 
benefits, provides claim scrubbing and claim denial management; allow Electronic  
Remittance Advices (ERA), etcetera.
• Educate and train at least one or two staff members to be PM system super- users. 
Include on-going PM system training.
• Verify and update PM system with codes, fees and specific payer nuances as needed.
• Provide on-going staff training
• Keep up with payer coding requirements/changes.  
• Sign-up for access to provider portals.
