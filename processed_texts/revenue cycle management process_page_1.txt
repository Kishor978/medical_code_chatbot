Revenue Cycle Management Process (RCM) 
The RCM process begins with the first patient contact and ends once their services have been paid. All 
administrative and clinical functions contribute to the capture, management, and collection of revenue. 
Tasks are assigned to the Front-end/reception area, billing, clinical/providers and administrators.   The 
tables below display the typical duties found in each of these areas but can vary depending upon 
resources and staffing.  These tables can be used as a guide to determine if these functions are being 
performed in your LHD.
