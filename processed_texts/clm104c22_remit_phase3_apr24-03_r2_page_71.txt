Standard adjustment reason codes are used on the Medicare electronic and paper 
remittance advice.  The indicated wording may not be modified without approval of the 
Health Care Code Maintenance Committee.  These codes were developed for use by all 
U.S. health payers.  As a result, they are generic, and there are a number of codes that do 
not apply to Medicare.
