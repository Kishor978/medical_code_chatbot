50.1 - The Do Not Forward (DNF) Initiative 
B-02-023, A-02-012, R1763B3 
(Rev.) 
As part of the Medicare DNF Initiative, Carriers, DMERCs and users of the Arkansas 
Part A Standard System (APASS) must use "return service requested" envelopes for 
mailing all hardcopy remittance advices.  When the post office returns a remittance 
advice due to an incorrect address, follow the same procedures you follow for returned 
checks; that is: 
• Flag the provider "DNF"; 
• Carrier staff must notify the provider enrollment area, and DMERCs must notify 
the National Supplier Clearing House (NSC); 
• Cease generating any further payments or remittance advice to that provider or 
supplier until they furnish a new address that is verified; and 
• When the provider returns a new address, remove the DNF flag after the address 
has been verified, and pay the provider any funds you are still holding due to a 
DNF flag.  You must also reissue any remittance advice you have been holding as 
well.
