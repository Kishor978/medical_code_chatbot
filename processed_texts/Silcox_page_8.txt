EXAMPLE OF BALANCE #1:  CONCURRENT BILLING
INTENT
• Per the Steering Committee Guidance, it 
is the Intent of Codes 97155 (Protocol 
Modification with Simultaneous 
Direction) and 97153 (Treatment by 
Protocol) to be billed Concurrently.
IMPLEMENTATION
• Providers do not need to seek to have 
this in writing to move forward, the 
language of the code and supplemental 
guidance reflect intent and purpose.
• Providers do, however, need to watch for                                                                              
documented payer policies that 
“disallow” this and continue to educate 
health plans of the intent.
