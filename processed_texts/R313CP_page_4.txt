New codes from N225 to N245 have been created by splitting 21 existing codes to help automate 
provider action.  The rationale for splitting these codes is that if a document is missing, the 
provider action would involve sending the document to Medicare.  On the other hand if the 
document sent is incomplete/invalid, providers need to research and rectify before sending the 
corrected document to Medicare.  This is a different action than just sending the missing 
document. Medicare contractors must use the new codes as appropriate in lieu of the existing 
codes.  For example if the consent form is incomplete/invalid, use code N228, and N3 only if it is 
missing.  Following is a list showing the new codes and the source code that has been split to 
create the new code:
