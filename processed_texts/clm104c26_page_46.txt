The purpose of the MTUS Indicator Field is to indicate what the value entered into the 
MTUS Count Field means.  There are 6 indicator values, as follows: 
 
Indicator Description 
0 No allowed services 
1 Ambulance transportation miles 
2 Anesthesia Time Units 
3 Services  
4 Oxygen units 
5 Units of Blood 
 
Examples of how to code these fields are specified in ยง10.9.1 below. 
 
10.9.1 - Methodology for Coding Number of Services, MTUS Count and 
MTUS Indicator Fields 
(Rev. 1970, Issued: 05-21-10, Effective: 10-01-2010, Implementation: 10-04-10) 
 
The following instructions should be used as a guide for coding the number of services, 
MTUS Count and MTUS Indicator fields on the Part B Physician/Supplier Claim.  These 
fields are documented in the CMS National Claims History Data Dictionary as 
CWFB_SRVC_CNT, CWFB_MTUS_CNT, and CWFB_MTUS_IND_CD, respectively.  
Services not falling into examples B, C, E, or F should be coded as shown in example D 
(services/pricing units). 
 
A. No Allowed Services - (CWFB_MTUS_IND_CD = 0) 
 
For claims reporting no allowed services, the following example should be used to code 
the line item: 
 
A total of 2 visits was reported for HCPCS code 99211:  Office or other outpatient visit 
for the management of an established patient.  Both services were denied. 
 
Number of services: 2 (furnished) 
MTUS (services): 0 (allowed) 
MTUS indicator: 0 
 
B. Ambulance Miles - (CWFB_MTUS_IND_CD = 1) 
 
For claims reporting ambulance miles, the following example should be used to code the 
line item: 
 
Mileage Reporting:  A total of 10 miles (1 trip) was reported for HCPCS code A0425: 
Ground mileage, per statute mile.
