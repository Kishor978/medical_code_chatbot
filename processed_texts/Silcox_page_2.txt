WHAT IS REVENUE CYCLE MANAGEMENT?
• Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is the process to set yourself up for success in being reimbursed for 
services performed through various funding sources. It is the full cycle from credentialing and contracting 
with funding sources, to patient intake, to reimbursement of claims and recording in accounting software. 
• For healthcare insurance funders, it includes the proper steps to complete prior to generating claims to 
ensure the highest level of compliance for reimbursement. The revenue cycle consists of payer policies and 
guidelines, claims submission, denials and appeals and the tracking of each aspect of the cycle.
• The financial aspect of the revenue cycle can determine your risks and strengths in remaining solvent in your 
practice as well as your success in passing audits. Maintaining ethical billing standards and compliance are key 
to contributing to the best practices of client/patient care, combating fraud, waste and abuse according to 
CMS standards.
