Intermediaries, carriers, and Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERCs) 
send to providers, physicians, and suppliers, as a companion to claim payments, a notice 
of payment, referred to as the Remittance Advice (RA).  RAs explain the payment and 
any adjustment(s) made.  For each claim or line item payment, reduction, or denial, there 
is an associated remittance advice item.  Payment for multiple claims can be reported on 
one transmission of the remittance advice.  RA notices can be produced and transferred in 
either paper or electronic format. 
Carriers and DMERCs also send informational RAs to physicians that do not accept 
assignment (acceptance of direct Medicare payments instead of billing the patient), unless 
the beneficiary or physician requests that the remittance notice be suppressed.  An 
informational RA is identical to other RAs, but must carry a standard message to notify 
physicians that do not accept assignment that they do not have appeal rights beyond those 
afforded when limitation on liability (rules regulating the amount of liability that an 
entity can accrue because of medical services which are not covered by Medicare) 
applies.  Suppliers that do not accept assignment may not be sent an RA. 
In order to implement the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Administrative Simplification provisions for Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) 
transactions, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has established an 
implementation guide for a HIPAA compliant version of the X12N 835 (Health Care 
Claim/Payment Advice).  An implementation guide is a reference document governing 
the implementation of an electronic format, it contains all information necessary to use 
the subject format, e.g., instructions and structures.  This HIPAA compliant 835 has been 
established as a national standard for use by all health plans in the United States, 
including Medicare intermediaries, carriers, and DMERCs.  Medicare requires the use of 
this format exclusively for ERAs.  Medicare has also established paper formats that must 
be used by carriers, DMERCs and intermediaries. 
The HIPAA compliant version of the 835 includes some significant changes from earlier 
versions of the 835 supported by Medicare.  See appendix D of the 835 version 4010 
implementation guide for a summary of these changes.  Implementation guides may be
