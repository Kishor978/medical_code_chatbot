NOTE: Pre-4010, NJ was reported in the AMT segment to report the 
gross amount of payment made by the primary payer on the claim.  NJ is 
not approved for use in 4010.  In 4010, primary payment reporting will be 
limited to the use of claim adjustment reason code 23 to convey the 
amount of the primary payment that impacted the Medicare payment 
calculation.  This may be less than the gross payment made by the primary 
payer.  Since Medicare would be primary in this instance, the provider 
would already have been notified of the gross amount of the primary’s 
payment by that payer.  This is not considered an essential data element 
for a secondary payer’s remittance advice.
