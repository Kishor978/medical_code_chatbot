10.8 - Requirements for Specialty Codes 
(Rev. 1725, Issued: 05-01-09, Effective: 07-01-09, Implementation: 07-06-09) 
 
Medicare physician/non-physician practitioner specialty codes describe the 
specific/unique types of medicine that physicians and non-physician practitioners (and 
certain other suppliers) practice.  Physicians self-designate their Medicare physician 
specialty on their Medicare enrollment application (CMS-855I) or on the Internet-based 
Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System.  Non-physician practitioners are 
assigned a Medicare specialty code when they enroll based on their profession.  Specialty 
codes are used by CMS for programmatic and claims processing purposes. 
 
A. A physician specialty association will submit a specialty code request to the Director, 
Division of Practitioner Services, Center for Medicare Management, Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mail Stop C4-01-26, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, 
MD 21244.
