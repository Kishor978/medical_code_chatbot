does not substantiate the need for this level of service.  If you 
believe the service should have been fully covered as billed, or if 
you did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to 
know that we would not pay for this level of service, or if you 
notified the patient in writing in advance that we would not pay 
for this level of service and he/she agreed in writing to pay, ask 
us to review your claim within 120 days of the date of this notice.  
If you do not request a review, we will, upon application from the 
patient, reimburse him/her for the amount you have collected 
from him/her in excess of any deductible and coinsurance 
amounts.  We will recover the reimbursement from you as an 
overpayment.
