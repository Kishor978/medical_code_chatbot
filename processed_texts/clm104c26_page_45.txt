10.9 - Miles/Times/Units/Services (MTUS) 
(Rev. 1970, Issued: 05-21-10, Effective: 10-01-2010, Implementation: 10-04-10) 
 
Miles/Times/Units/Services (MTUS) count and MTUS indicator fields are on Part B 
Physician/Supplier Claims.  These fields are documented in the CMS National Claims 
History Data Dictionary. 
 
Shared systems are to put MTUS count and MTUS indicators on all claims at the line 
item level. 
 
The purpose of the MTUS Count Field on the line item is to document additional 
information reflecting certain volumes related to indicators.  In most cases, the value in 
this field will be the same as in the Service Count Field on the line item; however, for 
services such as anesthesia the field values will differ.  In this case, the service count field 
will likely contain a value of 1 for the occurrence of the surgery while the MTUS Count 
Field will contain the actual time units that the anesthesiologist spent with the patient in 
15 minute increments or a fraction thereof.
