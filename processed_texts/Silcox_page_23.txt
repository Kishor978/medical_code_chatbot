ETHICAL BILLING PRACTICES
• During this time, don’t lose sight of Ethical Billing practices to keep your organization out of harm’s way 
of unintended fraudulent billing or what may be perceived as abuse in an audit.
- Be sure your internal team or outsourced billing company is using all available resources and is well versed in the intent 
of the codes and staying connected with published payer policies for each health plan you work with.
- Recognize that some health plans were using the Category III codes in non-standard ways. For example, 
TRICARE independently utilized 0360T/0361T for Supervised Fieldwork which was a non-standard use of a code that 
did not correlate with this service. Other health plans had granted authorization and/or given guidance to use 
the Category III codes for non face-to-face activities, despite the language of the code referencing Category III 
codes were also for face-to-face activities.
- Ground yourself in the difference between Case Supervision and supervision related to an RBT certificant. 
Many activities performed during Protocol Modification while simultaneously directing a technician may qualify for 
the certificant supervision requirements, but some may be considered practice and overhead expense.
- Know that there could be a period of time where there is not a stand-alone code for indirect services and 
plan accordingly.
