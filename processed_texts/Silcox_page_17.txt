PROTOCOL MODIFICATION
.
(PARAPHRASED FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE)
• Adaptive behavior service protocol modification involves changes made by the QHP to the 
procedures for implementing an adaptive behavior service. 
• Protocol modification includes but is not limited to 
• (a) adjustments to specific components of a protocol (e.g., treatment targets, treatment goals, observation 
and measurement, reinforcers, reinforcer delivery, prompts, instructions, materials, discriminative stimuli, 
contextual variables); (b) observations to determine if the protocol components are functioning effectively 
for the patient or require adjustments; (c) active direction of a technician while the technician delivers a 
service to a patient to ensure that the procedures are being implemented correctly, to correct errors in 
implementation, or to train the technician to implement a modified protocol; and (d) QHP implementation 
of the protocol with the patient to determine if changes are needed to improve patient progress or to test 
a modified protocol.
