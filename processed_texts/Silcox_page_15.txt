97151 – BEHAVIOR IDENTIFICATION ASSESSMENT 
…CONTINUED
• CPT code 97151 is for development of an initial or revised treatment plan as well as assessment 
to identify initial or revised treatment targets by the QHP (LBA or BCBA). There is no code for 
ongoing assessment and revision of treatment targets and protocols by the QHP in the Category I 
codes for Adaptive Behavior Services.
• Those "indirect services" are bundled with the new treatment codes, meaning that providers need 
to negotiate rates for those codes that take into account not only the direct treatment of the 
client by the technician or QHP ,  but also the work the QHP does before and after treatment 
sessions.
• Providers also should seek to request a stand alone code for Treatment Planning whenever 
possible.
