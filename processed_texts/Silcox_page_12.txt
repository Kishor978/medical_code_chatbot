EXAMPLE OF BALANCE #4:  MUE LIMITS
INTENT
• CMS published MUE (medically unlikely 
edit) limits are applied to Adaptive 
Behavior Service Category I codes.
• CMS agreed to modify 97151 from 2 
hours “per day” to 8 hours per day and 
will publish this change 4/1/19.
IMPLEMENTATION
• Health plans that apply MUE limits may 
apply the 97151 early limit until the 
published change.
• TRICARE has identified their own MUE 
limits per code.
• MUE limits are not guidelines for 
requesting what is medically necessary 
for treatment.
